- **Remote Control**: Control inverter work modes, battery charging parameters, and time-of-use settings
- **Home Assistant Integration**: Seamless integration with Home Assistant via ESPHome API
- **Safety Features**: Automatic fallback to safe operating parameters when connection to Home Assistant is lost
- **Modular Design**: Clean, maintainable code structure with separate packages for different system components
- **Multiple Inverter Support**: Currently supports both low voltage (SG04LP3) and high voltage (SG01HP3) Deye inverters

## üõ†Ô∏è Hardware Requirements

- **ESP Development Board** (e.g., ESP32-DevKit V1)
- **RS485 to TTL Converter**
- **PV Inverter** with Modbus RTU support
- **Connecting Cables** (for RS485 communication)

## üîå Wiring

Connect your ESP32-DevKit V1 to the inverter's Modbus port:

```
ESP32          RS485 Converter    Inverter
GPIO17 (TX) -> DI/A+           -> A+ (Modbus)
GPIO16 (RX) -> RO/B-           -> B- (Modbus)
3.3V        -> VCC             
GND         -> GND             -> GND (Modbus)
```

**Note**: Some RS485 converters may require a flow control pin. Uncomment and configure the `flow_control_pin` in the main configuration if needed.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

   ```
2. Click **"EDIT"** on your newly created device
3. **Replace the entire content** with the configuration from [`pv-inverter.yaml`](pv-inverter.yaml)
4. Click **"SAVE"** and then **"INSTALL"**

#### Step 4: Flash to ESP32
1. Connect your ESP32 to your computer via USB
2. Click **"Plug into this computer"**
3. Select the correct COM port
4. Click **"INSTALL"** and wait for the process to complete
5. Click **"STOP LOGS"** when installation is finished

#### Step 5: Connect Hardware
1. Disconnect ESP32 from computer
2. Connect RS485 converter according to wiring diagram above
3. Power up the ESP32 (via USB power adapter or external power)
4. The device should appear in Home Assistant automatically under **Settings** ‚Üí **Devices & Services** ‚Üí **ESPHome**

### Method 2: ESPHome CLI

If you prefer using command line or don't have Home Assistant:

1. **Install ESPHome CLI**:
   ```bash
   pip install esphome
   ```

2. **Download Configuration**:
   ```bash
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lewa-Reka/esphome-pv-inverter/main/pv-inverter.yaml
   ```

3. **Create secrets.yaml**:
